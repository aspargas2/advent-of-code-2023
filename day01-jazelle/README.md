 For the first day, I decided to get out of the way an "architecture" that caused me a disproportionately large amount of [grief](https://github.com/aspargas2/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main/day05-jazelle) last year. For those unaware, [Jazelle DBX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazelle) is a hardware extension present in some ARMv5, v6, and v7 processors that allows for direct execution of Java bytecode. Only some instructions are implemented in hardware (the others return to ARM mode where a JVM would usually handle them), so I restricted myself to the ones handled in hardware and solved day 1 in hand-written bytecode. This bytecode was run on the ARMv6k in a New 2DS XL: [output.jpg](output.jpg). Thanks to [Sono's libjz](https://github.com/SonoSooS/libjz) and [this page](https://hackspire.org/index.php/Jazelle) for providing documentation and reference code necessary to making this work.
