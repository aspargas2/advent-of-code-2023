Another day of trying to get a weird architecture from [last time](https://github.com/aspargas2/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main/day08-teak) out of the way. Day 2 was run on an XpertTeak, the DSP chip used in the various models of the Nintendo 3DS. [teakra](https://github.com/wwylele/teakra) was used to assemble the solution code, and the 3dsx code in the `hwtest` folder of the teakra repo was used as a base for uploading code to the DSP. Solutions were obtained by running on my New 2DS XL: [output.jpg](output.jpg).
